This was my Java project to explain an Operating System concept - Deadlocks. I implemented an interactive drawing board to create resource allocation graphs. Banker's algorithm then runs on the graph and tells whether the graph is in a Deadlock state or Safe State. Algorithms for Deadlock Prevention, Avoidance and Recovery can also be simulated. There is also a view to the analyze the concerned data structures while the algorithm runs.
